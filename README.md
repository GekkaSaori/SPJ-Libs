# SPJ-Libs
A C++ Library for Cena Special Judge

Because there isn't a SPJ interface for C / C++ in Cena till now, I write a simple C header for this.

Please read the example file ``SPJ-A+B.cpp`` for details.

Issues & PRs are welcomed.

Now Lemon is supported, too.

Same Interfaces are used for both two libraries.
